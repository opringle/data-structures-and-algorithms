# Singly Linked List

A singly-linked list is a data structure where each node consists of a value and a pointer to the next value in the list. This means data does not need to be stored contiguously in memory. The advantage of a linked list is that items can be added or removed from the beggining of the list in constant time. Unlike an array, accessing the Kth item cannot be done in constant time because you need to loop through the list to find it.

# Doubly Linked List

In a doubly linked list, each node has a value, a pointer to the next node and a pointer to the previous node.

# Inserting a node

First, set the pointers for the node you are inserting. After this is done, set the pointers for the previous and next node.
